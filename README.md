Basic notification UI implemented in react with websockets. Behavior styled after OS X notifications. As a new websocket update is received, a notificaiton appears.

## Requirements

  * React
  * WebSocketRails
  * Sass

## TODO

  * WebSocketRails is what I used on my project. Should make it more generic.
  * CommonJS modularize.

Happy to accept pull requests.
